Blade Runner is a 1982 American neo-noir dystopian science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos. The screenplay, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is a modified film adaptation of the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick.

The film depicts Los Angeles in November 2019, in which genetically engineered replicants, which are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other "mega-corporations" around the world. The use of  replicants on Earth is banned and they are exclusively utilized for dangerous or menial work on Space colonization|off-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and killed ("retired") by special police operatives known as "Blade Runners". The plot focuses on a desperate group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt-out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.

==Plot==
 
 Gaff (Edward Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). Deckard, whose job as a "Blade Runner" was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and destroy them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.
 Zhora (Joanna Pris (Daryl Hannah). Deckard initially refuses, but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees.
 Rachael (Sean Young) is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. Rachael has been given false memories to provide an "emotional cushion". As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant.

Events are then set into motion that pit Deckards search for the replicants against their search for Tyrell to force him to extend their lives. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of Characters in Blade Runner#J.F. Sebastian|J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson), a gifted designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are only implants taken from a real person, she leaves his apartment in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.

While searching Leons hotel room, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to also kill Rachael, who has absconded from the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd but is attacked by Leon. Rachael kills Leon using Deckards gun, and the two return to Deckards apartment, where he promises not to hunt her. Later they share an intimate moment; Rachael abruptly tries to leave, but Deckard physically restrains her and forces Rachael to kiss him.

Arriving at Sebastians apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of "Methuselah Syndrome", a genetic premature aging disorder, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrells secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done "questionable things" which Tyrell dismisses, praising Roys advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who then rides the elevator down alone.
 a monologue about how his memories are about to be lost; Roy dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard, "Its too bad she wont live, but then again, who does?" Deckard returns to his apartment to find Rachael sleeping in his bed. As they leave, Deckard finds a small tin-foil origami unicorn, a calling card left by Gaff. Depending on the version, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape.

==Themes==
 
 
Although Blade Runner is ostensibly an action film, it operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It is indebted to  ; protagonist-narration (removed in later versions); dark and shadowy cinematography; and the questionable moral outlook of the hero – in this case, extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity. Barlow, Aaron "Reel Toads and Imaginary Cities: Philip K. Dick, Blade Runner and the Contemporary Science Fiction Movie" in Brooker, pp. 43–58   It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of   of 1851,    though Scott has said that was coincidental. 

Blade Runner delves into the implications of technology on the environment and on society by reaching to the past, using literature,   for the British Sunday newspaper The Observer in 2002. Scott "liked the idea of exploring pain" in the wake of his brothers skin cancer death: "When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me." 

An aura of paranoia suffuses the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored – especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories. Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale, hand in hand with the absence of any natural life, with artificial animals substituting for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extra-terrestrial ("off-world") colonies. 
The dystopian themes explored in Blade Runner are an early example of cyberpunk concepts expanding into film. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.   

These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for Blade Runner s central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals – seemingly an essential indicator of someones "humanity". The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is human, and forces the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human. 

The question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the films release.  Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity.  Ridley Scott has confirmed that in his vision Deckard is a replicant.  {{Citation

Deckards unicorn dream sequence, inserted into the Directors Cut, coinciding with Gaffs parting gift of an origami unicorn is seen by many as showing that Deckard is a replicant – as Gaff could have accessed Deckards implanted memories.   The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity,  or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the films main theme.  The inherent ambiguity and uncertainty of the film, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from their own perspectives. 

==Production  ==

===Casting===
 
Casting the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the characters dialogue with Mitchum in mind.    Director Ridley Scott and the films producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with Dustin Hoffman, who eventually departed over differences in vision.  Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the Star Wars films, Fords interest in the Blade Runner story, and discussions with Steven Spielberg who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark at the time and strongly praised Fords work in the film.  Following his success in films like Star Wars (1977) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth.  According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Al Pacino, and Burt Reynolds. 

 . He portrayed the "cold, aryan, flawless" replicant Roy Batty in Blade Runner.]] Katie Tippel, Turkish Delight).  Hauers portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, "the perfect Batty—cold, Aryan race|Aryan, flawless".  Of the many films Hauer has done, Blade Runner is his favorite. As he explained in a live chat in 2001,  "Blade Runner needs no explanation. It just  . All of the best. There is nothing like it. To be part of a real masterpiece which changed the worlds thinking. Its awesome."  Hauer wrote his characters "tears in the rain" speech himself and presented the words to Scott on set prior to filming.

Blade Runner used a number of then-lesser-known actors: Sean Young portrays Rachael, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrells niece, causing her to believe she is human;  Nina Axelrod auditioned for the role.  Daryl Hannah portrays Pris, a "basic pleasure model" replicant; Stacey Nelkin auditioned for the role, but was given another part in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming.  Casting Pris and Rachael was challenging, requiring several screen tests, with Morgan Paull playing the role of Deckard. Paull was cast as Deckards fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests.  Brion James portrays Leon Kowalski, a combat replicant, and Joanna Cassidy portrays Zhora, an assassin replicant. 
Edward James Olmos portrays Gaff. Olmos used his diverse ethnic background, and personal research, to help create the fictional "Cityspeak" language his character uses in the film. Sammon, pp. 115–116  His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, "Horse dick  ! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner."  M. Emmet Walsh plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.&nbsp;F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions,  and shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease;  Joe Pantoliano was considered for the role.  James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrays the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.

  optioned it.  Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herbs son Robert: "Jaffes screenplay was so terribly done&nbsp;... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment? " 

The screenplay by Hampton Fancher  was optioned in 1977.  Producer Michael Deeley became interested in Fanchers draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of Dune (film)|Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brothers recent death.  He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US$13&nbsp;million to $15&nbsp;million. Fanchers script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and faith, which had featured heavily in the novel, and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S. Burroughs for Alan E. Nourses novel The Bladerunner (1974), titled Blade Runner (a movie).  Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles. Eventually he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites. 
 Sir Run Run Shaw, and Tandem Productions. 

Philip K. Dick became concerned that no one had informed him about the films production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood.  After Dick criticized an early version of Hampton Fanchers script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the David Peoples rewrite.  Although Dick died shortly before the films release, he was pleased with the rewritten script, and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Ridley Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it. Sammon, p. 284  He said, "I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbulls special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly." He also approved of the films script, saying, "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel."    The motion picture was dedicated to Dick.  Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later. 

In 1992, Ford revealed, "Blade Runner is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley."  Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: "When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a f**king    nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the directors interests." {{citation

}}  "I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it."  
In 2006 Scott was asked "Whos the biggest pain in the arse youve ever worked with?", he replied: "Its got to be Harrison&nbsp;... hell forgive me because now I get on with him. Now hes become charming. But he knows a lot, thats the problem. When we worked together it was my first film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie."  Ford said of Scott in 2000: "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and Im over it."  In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover&nbsp;... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another."  Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, having already done his interviews. "Harrisons fully on board", said Scott. 

The Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles served as a filming location, and a Warner Bros. backlot housed the LA 2019 streets. Test screenings resulted in several changes including adding a voice over, a happy ending, and the removal of a Holden hospital scene. The relationship between the filmmakers and the investors was difficult, which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film.  Crew members created T-shirts during filming saying, "Yes Guvnor, My Ass" that mocked Scotts unfavorable comparison of U.S. and British crews; Scott responded with a T-shirt of his own, "Xenophobia Sucks" making the incident known as the T-shirt war.    

===Design===
 
 Moebius contributed, as stylistic mood sources.  He also drew on the landscape of "Hong Kong on a very bad day"  and the industrial landscape of his one-time home in north east England.   The visual style of the movie is influenced by the work of Futurist Italian architect, Antonio SantElia.  Scott hired Syd Mead as his concept artist who, like Scott, was influenced by Métal Hurlant.  Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre-production of Blade Runner, but he declined so that he could work on René Lalouxs animated film Les Maîtres du temps – a decision that he later regretted.  Production designer Lawrence G. Paull and art director David Snyder realized Scotts and Meads sketches. Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich supervised the special effects for the film.

Blade Runner has numerous deep similarities to Fritz Langs Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis, including a built-up urban environment, in which the wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building – the Stadtkrone Tower in Metropolis and the Tyrell Building in Blade Runner. Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from Metropolis when lining up Blade Runner s miniature building shots. 

"Spinner" is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A Spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using  , jet, and anti-gravity"    Meads conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 working vehicles by automobile customizer Gene Winfield.  A Spinner is on permanent exhibit at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington.

The Voight-Kampff machine (or device) is a fictional interrogation tool, originating in the book where it is spelled Voigt-Kampff. The Voight-Kampff is a polygraph-like machine used by Blade Runners to assist in the testing of an individual to determine if he or she is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate, and eye movement in response to emotionally provocative questions.  In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes "six or seven" questions to make a determination. In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant.

===Music===
 
 Academy Award Someone To Watch Over Me. 

Along with Vangelis compositions and ambient textures, the films sound scape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia - "Ogi No Mato" or "The Folding Fan as a Target" from the Nonesuch Records release Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music - and a track by harpist Gail Laughton from "Harps of the Ancient Temples" on Laurel Records. 
 BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Directors Cut version would a substantial amount of the films score see commercial release. 

These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many bootleg recordings over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 "Off World Music, Ltd" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis official CD in 1994.  A set with three CDs of Blade Runner-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled Blade Runner Trilogy, the first disc contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second features previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third disc is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.

==Release==
Blade Runner was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer   and Alien (film)|Alien) had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the date his "lucky day". 
The gross for the opening weekend was a disappointing $6.15&nbsp;million.  A significant factor in the films rather poor box office performance was that it was released around the same time as other science fiction films, including  , and, most significantly, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which dominated box office revenues that summer. 

===Critical reception===
Film critics were polarized as some felt the story had taken a back seat to special effects and that it was not the action/adventure the studio had advertised. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time. 
 The State and Columbia Record described it as "science fiction pornography".  Pauline Kael noted that with its "extraordinary" congested-megalopolis sets, Blade Runner "has its own look, and a visionary sci-fi movie that has its own look cant be ignored – it has its place in film history" but "hasnt been thought out in human terms".    Roger Ebert praised the visuals of both the original Blade Runner and the Directors Cut versions and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin.  In 2007, upon release of The Final Cut, Ebert somewhat revised his original opinion of the film and added it to his list of Great Movies, while noting, "I have been assured that my problems in the past with Blade Runner represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it?"  Blade Runner holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 8.4 out of 10 from 96 reviews.  The sites main consensus reads "Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scotts mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece."

===Versions===
 
Several different versions of Blade Runner have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113&nbsp;minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version.   The workprint was shown as a directors cut without Scotts approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theater.  Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official directors cut.  A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut. 

Two versions were shown in the films 1982 theatrical release: the U.S. theatrical version (116&nbsp;minutes), known as the original version or Domestic Cut, released on Betamax and VHS in 1983 and Laserdisc in 1987; and the International Cut (117&nbsp;minutes), also known as the "Criterion Edition" or "uncut version", which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S., and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases, it was later released on VHS and Criterion Collection Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a "10th Anniversary Edition". 

Scotts Directors Cut (1991, 116&nbsp;minutes) was made available on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997. Significant changes from the theatrical version include: the removal of Deckards voice-over; re-insertion of a unicorn sequence; and removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the Directors Cut.  Scotts The Final Cut (2007, 117&nbsp;minutes) was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc in December 2007.  This is the only version over which Scott had complete editorial control.

===In other media===
Before the films principal photography began, Cinefantastique magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write an article about Blade Runner s production which became the book Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner. 
The book chronicles Blade Runner s evolution, focusing on film-set politics, especially the British directors experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer Alan Ladd, Jr. has said, "Harrison wouldnt speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldnt speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was ready to kill Ridley, said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadnt been talked out of it." 
Future Noir has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences, and photographs of the films production and preliminary sketches. A second edition of Future Noir was published in 2007. 

Philip K. Dick refused a $400,000 offer to write a Blade Runner novelization, saying: "  told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience" and "  would have probably been disastrous to me artistically." He added, "That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization – they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles."  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was eventually reprinted as a movie tie-in (book)|tie-in, with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the Blade Runner title.

}}  The Total Recall film was also based on a Philip K. Dick story, "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"; many similarities between Total Recall 2070 and Blade Runner were noted, as well as apparent inspiration from Isaac Asimovs The Caves of Steel and the TV series Holmes & Yo-Yo. 

The film has been the subject of several documentaries. On the Edge of Blade Runner (2000, 55&nbsp;minutes) was directed by Andrew Abbott and hosted/written by   for The Final Cut version of the film. It was culled from over 80 interviews, including Ford, Young, and Scott.  The documentary consists of eight chapters, each covering a portion of the film-making – or in the case of the final chapter, the films controversial legacy.  All Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cut (2007, 29&nbsp;minutes), produced by Paul Prischman, appears on the Blade Runner Ultimate Collectors Edition and provides an overview of the films multiple versions and their origins, as well as detailing the seven-year-long restoration, enhancement and remastering process behind The Final Cut. 

==Sequels==
Dicks friend,   (1995),   (1996), and   (2000). By 1999, Stuart Hazeldine had written a sequel to Blade Runner based on The Edge of Human, titled Blade Runner Down; the project was shelved due to rights issues.    Blade Runner co-author David Peoples wrote the 1998 action film Soldier (1998 American film)|Soldier, which was referred to by him as a "sidequel" or spiritual successor to the original film. 

Scott considered developing a sequel, tentatively titled Metropolis.  At the 2007 Comic-Con Scott again announced that he was considering a sequel to the film.  Eagle Eye co-writer Travis Wright worked with producer Bud Yorkin for several years on the project. His colleague John Glenn, who left the project by 2008, stated the script explores the nature of the off-world colonies as well as what happens to the Tyrell Corporation in the wake of its founders death. 
 web and then perhaps television. Due to rights issues the proposed series was not to be linked too closely to the characters or events of the 1982 film.  On February 7, 2010, it was announced that production on Purefold had ceased, due to funding problems.  On March 4, 2011, io9 reported that Yorkin was developing a new Blade Runner film.  It was also reported that month that director Christopher Nolan was the desired choice to make the film. 

It was announced on August 18, 2011, that Scott was to direct a new Blade Runner movie, with filming to begin no earlier than 2013. Indications from producer Andrew Kosove were that Ford was unlikely to be involved in the project.   Scott later said that the film was "liable to be a sequel" but without the previous cast, and that he was close to finding a writer that "might be able to help   deliver".  On February 6, 2012, Kosove denied that any casting considerations had been made in response to buzz that Ford might reprise his role, saying, "It is absolutely, patently false that there has been any discussion about Harrison Ford being in Blade Runner. To be clear, what we are trying to do with Ridley now is go through the painstaking process of trying to break the back of the story&nbsp;... The casting of the movie could not be further from our minds at this moment."  When Scott was asked about the possibility of a sequel in October 2012, he said, "Its not a rumor—its happening. With Harrison Ford? I dont know yet. Is he too old? Well, he was a Nexus-6 so we dont know how long he can live. And thats all Im going to say at this stage." 

In November 2014, Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine reported that Scott was no longer the director for the film and would only fulfill a producers role. Scott also revealed that Fords character will only appear in "the third act" of the sequel.  In February 2015, Alcon Entertainment confirmed that Scott will not be back to direct, and they were negotiating with Prisoners (2013 film)|Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve. Ford, however, will return, as will original writer Hampton Fancher, and the film is expected to enter production in mid-2016.
