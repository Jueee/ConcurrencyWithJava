The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan Raimi|Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz.

 cult following, along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to Irvin Shapiro, who died during the films production in 1989 on New Years Day. The effects artist on the film was Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger from KNB Effects.

==Plot==
After being pulled through a time portal, Ash Williams lands in 1300 AD, where he is almost immediately captured by Lord Arthurs men, who suspect him to be an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he fights off a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthurs Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free (as he knew Henry was innocent, and his persecution was simply a witch hunt) and killing a deadite in full view of everyone, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He also grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthurs fallen knights.
 Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, a book with magical powers.  After bidding goodbye to Sheila, Ash starts his search for the Necronomicon. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash through the woods. Fleeing, he ducks into a windmill where he crashes into a mirror. The small reflections of Ash climb out from the shattered mirror and torment him. One of the reflections dives down Ashs throat and uses his body to become a life-sized clone of Ash and attack him, after which Ash kills and buries the clone.

When he arrives at the Necronomicon s location, he finds three books instead of one. Ash eventually finds the real one and attempts to say the magic phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely&nbsp;â€“ "Klaatu barada nikto". However, forgetting the last word, he tries to trick the book by mumbling and coughing the missing word. He then grabs the book from the cradle, and rushes back to the castle, while the dead rise from graves all around. During Ashs panicked ride back, his evil copy rises from his grave and unites the Deadites into the Army of Darkness.
 Oldsmobile Delta 88, and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry in the process. The Wise Men return him to his own time, giving him a potion to drink after reciting the magic phrase.

Back in the present, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at his job, working in housewares at a store called "S-Mart". As he talks to a girl who is interested in his story, a surviving deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word of the magic phrase, attacks the customers. Ash attacks and kills it using weaponry found in the store, finally ending the deadite threat.

===Original ending===
 
The original ending, preferred by Raimi and Campbell themselves, in which Ash oversleeps in the cave and wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future, was restored to the film for the UK VHS release, which also had the S-Mart ending put in as a post-credit extra. This scene has been restored on the Army of Darkness: Directors Cut Region 3 DVD released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the "directors cut bootleg edition" DVD and the double-disc DVD, which also featured the S-Mart ending of the film. The S-Mart ending was shot for the American release; the studio wanted to end the film on a high note for the character of Ash. Raimi believed Ash to be more of a fool, which is why he liked to torture him so much in his films; Ash being a goof and drinking too much potion was in his character.

==Production==
Plans to make a third  , during the production of Evil Dead II.   This was used after Sam Raimi was unable to use his original title "The Medieval Dead." ("The Medieval Dead" would later be used as the films subtitle for its UK release as Army of Darkness: The Medieval Dead).

===Screenplay and pre-production=== The Rookie. Warren 2000, p. 140.   After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called Easy Wheels, Sam and his brother Ivan Raimi decided to co-write the film together. Warren 2000, p. 142.  They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of Darkman.  After filming Darkman, they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan "has a good sense of character" and that he brought more comedy into the script.   Campbell remembers, "We all decided, Get him out of the cabin. There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, Well, we all know that cabin, its time to move on. The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because its more interesting".  Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard. Warren 2000, p. 145. 
 Victor Flemings Joan of Arc that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in Army of Darkness.  A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the Joan of Arc storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.

===Principal photography=== Vasquez Rocks Introvision stage in Hollywood. Raimis use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the stop-motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen. Muir 2004, p. 153.  Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional rear projection that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates.  According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was "the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesnt exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character".   

Shooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days. Warren 2000, p. 147.  It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near Acton, California|Acton, California on the edge of the Mojave Desert, the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night. Muir 2004, p. 155.  Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene. Warren 2000, p. 151.  Money problems forced cinematographer Bill Pope to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend. Muir 2004, p. 156. 

It was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there. Muir 2004, p. 157.  Mesa remembers, "Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. Make him go through torture! So wed come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes".  Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons  that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects. 

===Post-production===
While Dino De Laurentiis gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production. Muir 2004, p. 159.  Universal was not happy with Raimis cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative.  A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with Bridget Fonda.  Raimi recalls, "Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe hes some cheesy hero". Warren 2000, p. 156. 
 sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. Muir 2004, p. 162.  The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for Army of Darkness was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.
 MPAA gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating.  In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating. 

===Music===
Danny Elfman, who composed the score for Darkman, wrote the "March of the Dead" theme for Army of Darkness. Warren 2000, p. 153.  After the re-shoots were completed, Joseph LoDuca, who composed the music for The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II, returned to score the film. Muir 2004, p. 160.   The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he took them in front of an orchestra.

==Sequel== Evil Dead, a reboot and loose continuation of the franchise, Raimi confirmed that the fourth Evil Dead film will be Army of Darkness 2. Campbell confirmed that he would star as an older, but not necessarily wiser, Ash.   At a WonderCon panel in March 2013, Campbell and Fede Alvarez, director of the reboot, stated that their ultimate plan was for Alvarezs Evil Dead 2 and Raimis Army of Darkness 2 to be followed by a seventh film which would merge the narratives of Ash and Mia.  On October 18, 2013, Campbell once again confirmed in an interview with ComicBook.com that he will be reprising his role as Ash in the sequel.  Fede Alvarez posted a status update on his Twitter account that Raimi will direct the sequel.  Campbell later commented that the rumor about him returning is false.  

In July 2014, Bruce Campbell stated it was likely the planned sequel would instead be a TV series with him as the star.  The series was green-lit by Starz for a 10 episode run and is called Ash vs. Evil Dead.   It will debut late 2015, with the pilot co-written and directed by Sam Raimi. http://www.blastr.com/2015-2-11/starzs-evil-dead-television-series-has-found-ashs-two-new-sidekicks
