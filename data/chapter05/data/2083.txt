}} filmmakers in history. They patented the cinematograph, which in contrast to Thomas Edison|Edisons "peepshow" kinetoscope allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple parties. Their first film, Sortie de lusine Lumière de Lyon, shot in 1894, is considered the first true motion picture.   

==History== La Martiniere, photographic firm where both brothers worked for him: Louis as a physicist and Auguste as a manager. Louis had made some improvements to the still-photograph process, the most notable being the dry-plate process, which was a major step towards moving images.

It was not until their father retired in 1892 that the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented a number of significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably film perforations (originally implemented by Emile Reynaud) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original cinématographe had been patented by Léon Guillaume Bouly on 12 February 1892.   The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895.   The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on March 19, 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.

==First film screenings== Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon (Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory).  Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.
 motion pictures — was further developed by the Lumières.

The public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following ten short films (in order of presentation): 
 La Sortie de lUsine Lumière à Lyon (literally, "the exit from the Lumière factory in Lyon", or, under its more common English title, Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory), 46 seconds
#Le Jardinier (lArroseur Arrosé) ("The Gardener", or "The Sprinkler Sprinkled"), 49 seconds Le Débarquement du Congrès de Photographie à Lyon ("the disembarkment of the Congress of Photographers in Lyon"), 48 seconds
#La Voltige ("Horse Trick Riders"), 46 seconds
#La Pêche aux poissons rouges ("fishing for goldfish"), 42 seconds
#Les Forgerons ("Blacksmiths"), 49 seconds
#Repas de bébé ("Babys Breakfast" (lit. "babys meal")), 41 seconds
#Le Saut à la couverture ("Jumping Onto the Blanket"), 41 seconds La Places des Cordeliers à Lyon ("Cordeliers Square in Lyon"—a street scene), 44 seconds La Mer (Baignade en mer) ("the sea  "), 38 seconds

The Lumières went on tour with the cinématographe in 1896, visiting Brussels (the first place a movie was played outside Paris on the Galleries Saint-Hubert on March 1. 1896), Bombay, London, Montreal, New York and Buenos Aires.

The moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with LArrivée dun Train en Gare de la Ciotat (literally, "the arrival of a train at La Ciotat", but more commonly known as Arrival of a Train at a Station) and Carmaux, défournage du coke (Drawing out the coke). Their actuality films, or actualités, are often cited as the first, primitive documentaries. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of LArroseur Arrosé.

 cinema is an invention without any future" and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as Georges Méliès. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography.  They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own bichromated glue process  , a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900.  This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process.  In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the "Autochrome Lumière", which was launched on the market in 1907. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following  merger with Ilford Photo|Ilford.  They also invented the color plate which really got photography on the road.

==Other early cinematographers==
  Max and Emil Skladanowsky, inventors of the Bioscop, had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (November 1, 1895, in Berlin). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.

Although the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for Cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.
