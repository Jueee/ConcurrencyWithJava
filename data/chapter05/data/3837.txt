==Plot== frontier town Howard Johnson," Olson N. lynch the new sheriff, with either result paving the way for him to take over the town.

With his quick wits and the assistance of drunken gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder), also known as "The Waco Kid" ("I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille"),    Bart works to overcome the townsfolks hostile reception. He defeats and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking (but surprisingly philosophical) henchman sent by Taggart and Lyle to kill Bart, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr is furious that his plans keep failing and decides to destroy Rock Ridge with a newly recruited and diverse army of thugs.

Bart gathers the town, along with the railroad workers, three miles east of Rock Ridge to build a fake town as a diversion. The workers labor all night to build a perfect replica, but with no people in it Bart realises it wont fool Lamarrs villains. Ordering the townspeople to make "exact replicas of themselves," Bart leaves with Jim and Mongo to construct a tollbooth. The booth delays the raiding party when they have to go back for "a shitload of dimes."

Once through the tollbooth, Lamarrs villains attack the fake town populated with dummies, which Bart boobytrapped with several dynamite bombs. Bart tries setting off the bombs but is unsuccessful as the detonator does not work.  Jim is given the task of exploding the bombs, and fires his pistol at them. After the bombs explode, launching bad guys skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains.

==Production==
The idea of Blazing Saddles came from an original story outline written by  , from Salon.com 

Blazing Saddles was Brooks first film shot in anamorphic format. To date, this film and History of the World, Part I are the only Brooks films in this format. 

Brooks had repeated conflicts with studio executives over the cast and content. They objected to both the highly provocative script and the "irregular" activities of the writers (particularly Richard Pryor, who reportedly led all-night writing jams fueled by loud music and drugs). Brooks wanted Pryor to play the sheriff, but Warner executives expressed concern over Pryors heavy drug use and alleged mental instability.  Cleavon Little was cast in the role, and Pryor continued as co-screenwriter.  In the midst of shooting, Gene Wilder — who had previously turned down the Hedley Lamarr role — was brought in to replace Gig Young, who collapsed during his first scene from what was later determined to be alcohol withdrawal syndrome.    

After an in-studio screening, Warner Bros. executives objected to constant use of the word "nigger", the flatulent campfire scene, and Mongo appearing to punch a horse, and asked Brooks to modify those scenes. Brooks declined, as his contract gave him control of the final cut.  He did remove the final line of Barts response to Lilis attempt to seduce him in the dark: "I hate to disappoint you, maam, but youre sucking my arm."    To an interviewers query about his frequent use of "nigger" in the script, Brooks responded that if Blazing Saddles were to be remade today, the controversial word would have to be omitted ("and then, youve got no movie...").  He added that he had received consistent support for its use from writer Richard Pryor, and lead actor Cleavon Little.

}} Page 36: Q: Blazing Saddles also makes frequent use of the "N-word." Could you get away with that today? A: Never. If they did a remake of Blazing Saddles today, they would leave out the N-word. And then, youve got no movie. And I wouldnt have used it so much if I didnt have Richard Pryor with me on the set as one of my writers. And Cleavon Little   was great. Even though it was allowed, I kept asking Cleavon, "Is that all right there? Is that too much there? Am I pushing this?" and hed say, "no, no, no, its perfect there." 

Brooks wanted the movies title song to reflect the western genre, and advertised in the trade papers for a "Frankie Laine-type" sound. Several days later, Laine himself visited Brooks office to offer his services. Brooks had not told Laine that the movie was a comedy: "Frankie sang his heart out... and we didnt have the heart to tell him it was a spoof&nbsp;— we just said, Oh, great! He never heard the whip cracks; we put those in later.  We got so lucky with his serious interpretation of the song." From the libretto of the La-LaLand Records soundtrack album 

In an interview included in the DVD release of Blazing Saddles, Brooks claimed that Hedy Lamarr threatened legal action on grounds that the films running "Hedley Lamarr" joke infringed on her right to privacy. This is lampooned in the film itself when Hedley corrects Governor Le Petomanes pronunciation of his name, and Le Petomane retorts, "What the hell are you worried about? This is 1874; youll be able to sue her! " Brooks said that he and the actress settled out of court for a small sum. In the same interview, Brooks related that John Wayne was offered a cameo role.  After reading the script Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was "too dirty" for his family image, but told Brooks that he "would be first in line to see the film". 

==Reception==
While the film is widely considered a classic comedy today, critical reaction was mixed when the film was first released. Vincent Canby wrote: 
 

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and called it a "crazed grabbag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a rubber chicken. Mostly, it succeeds. Its an audience picture; it doesnt have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course! What does that matter while Alex Karras is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?" 

The film grossed $119.5 million in the box office, becoming only the tenth film in history up to that time to pass the $100 million mark. 

On the film-critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has 90% positive reviews based on 49 reviews.

===TV pilot===
A television pilot was produced for CBS based on Andrew Bergmans initial story, titled Black Bart,  which was the original title of the film. It featured Louis Gossett, Jr. as Bart and Steve Landesberg as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named "Reb Jordan". Mel Brooks had little if anything to do with the pilot, as writer Andrew Bergman is listed as the sole creator. The pilot did not sell, but CBS aired it once on April 4, 1975. It was later included as a bonus feature on the Blazing Saddles 30th Anniversary DVD and the Blu-ray disc.

===Musical adaptation=== The Producers Young Frankenstein, rumors spread about a possible adaptation of Blazing Saddles. Brooks joked about the concept in the final number in Young Frankenstein, in which the full company sings, "next year, Blazing Saddles!" In 2010, Mel Brooks confirmed this, saying that the musical could be finished within a year. No creative team or plan has been announced. 

===Soundtrack=== John Morriss score.  Instrumental versions of all the songs are bonus tracks on the disc.  The disc features exclusive liner notes featuring comments from Mel Brooks and John Morris.
