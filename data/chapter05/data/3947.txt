 song of the same name. Although initially polarising some mainstream critics, the film is now widely acclaimed as one of the greatest films of the 1980s,     and earned Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director. As an example of a director casting against the norm, Blue Velvet is also noted for re-launching Hoppers career and for providing Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond the work as a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman for which she had until then been known.
 surrealist style he displayed in his debut Eraserhead (1977). The screenplay of Blue Velvet had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with many major studios declining it because of its strong sexual and violent content.    The independent studio De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, owned at the time by Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis, agreed to finance and produce the film.

==Plot==
Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) returns to his logging home town of Lumberton, North Carolina from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams (George Dickerson), through whom he reacquaints with the detectives daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern). She tells him details about the ear case and a suspicious woman, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), who may be connected to the case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothys apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.
 Blue Velvet", fellate him Frank Booth dry humping, sociopath whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. He continually refers to her as "Mommy" and to himself as both the "Daddy" and the "Baby", who "want to fuck." Frank has kidnapped Dorothys husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors; to "Do it for van Gogh." When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.
 robins that she interprets as a sign of hope for humanity. Clearly, Jeffrey and Sandy are attracted to each other, though Sandy has a boyfriend.

Jeffrey again visits Dorothys apartment and she tells him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothys performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothys robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends the next few days spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently goes to. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank. Jeffrey tells his new findings to Sandy and the two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again and the two have sex. When he refuses to hit her, though, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.
 In Dreams", sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a lumber yard and when he molests Dorothy, Jeffrey stands up to Frank by punching him. Franks cronies drag Jeffrey out of the car and Frank kisses Jeffreys face, intimidates him, and then savagely beats him to the overture of "In Dreams". Jeffrey wakes the next day at the same place and walks home, overcome with guilt and despair. He goes to the police station, where he notices that Sandys fathers partner is the Yellow Man—an officer named Lieutenant Detective Tom Gordon (Fred Pickler). Later at Sandys home, her father is amazed by Jeffreys story, but warns Jeffrey to stop his amateur sleuthing lest he endanger himself and the investigation. Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance together and profess their love, only to be confronted by Sandys boyfriend. A confrontation is averted when the group finds Dorothy, naked, battered, and distressed, on Jeffreys front lawn. Barely conscious, Dorothy calls Jeffrey "my lover", thereby revealing her intimacy with Jeffrey, causing Sandy to become upset and to slap Jeffrey, although she later forgives him.

The films story originated from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmakers mind over a period of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only "a feeling" and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste in 1987.        The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. "I dont know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else...The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect", Lynch remarked in an interview.   The third idea was Bobby Vintons classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time."    Lynch and Roth pitched the script to Warner Bros., who showed interest in the project. Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while". 

After completing   that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million.  This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis slate.  Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production.  "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment."  Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own production company to distribute it. 

The cast of Blue Velvet included several then-relatively unknown actors. Isabella Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her  .

The scene in which Dorothy appears naked outside was inspired by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it.  Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington. 

Lynchs original rough cut ran for approximately four hours.  He was contractually obligated to deliver a two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes.  He also made cuts at the request of the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAAs concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. Lynch announced in a radio interview on January 18, 2011, that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. It  later appeared on the 2011 special edition Blu-ray disc release of the film.  The final cut produced by Lynch runs for just under two hours.

==Interpretation==
Despite Blue Velvet s initial appearance as a mystery, the film operates on a number of thematic levels. The film owes a large debt to 1950s film noir, containing and exploring such conventions as the femme fatale (Dorothy Vallens), a seemingly unstoppable villain (Frank Booth), and the questionable moral outlook of the hero (Jeffrey Beaumont), as well as its unusual use of shadowy, sometimes dark cinematography.    Blue Velvet represents and establishes Lynchs famous "askew vision,"    and introduces several common elements of Lynchs work, some of which would later become his trademarks, including distorted characters, a polarized world, and debilitating damage to the skull or brain. Perhaps the most significant "Lynchian" trademark in the film is the depiction of unearthing a dark underbelly in a seemingly idealized small town;    Jeffrey even proclaims in the film that he is "seeing something that was always hidden", alluding to the films plot central idea. Lynchs characterization of films, symbols, and motifs have become well-known, and his particular style, characterised largely in Blue Velvet for the first time, has been written about extensively using descriptions like "dreamlike",    "ultraweird",    "dark", Nochimson, Martha (Autumn 2002). "Mulholland Drive by David Lynch", Film Quarterly, 56 (1), p. 37–45  and "oddball". Johnson, 2005, p. 6  Red curtains also show up in key scenes, specifically in Dorothys apartment, which have since become a Lynch trademark. The film has been compared to Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho (1960) because of its stark treatment of psychotic evil.    The premise of both films is curiosity, leading to an investigation that draws the lead characters into a hidden, voyeuristic underworld of crime.   
 The Night of the Hunter (1955) and the entire notion of film noir.    Lynch has called it a "film about things that are hidden—within a small city and within people."  Like many other Lynch films, Blue Velvet is immersed in pop culture imagery, both from the 1950s and the 1960s, as well as the 1980s. 
 Freudian approach to the film; considering it to be an expression of the traumatised innocence which characterises Lynchs work.   He claims that "Dorothy represents the sexual force of the mother   because she is forbidden and because she becomes the object of the unhealthy, infantile impulses at work in Jeffreys subconscious". 

===Symbolism=== robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film.  The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.

The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers is also a key symbolic element,  leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffreys troubles begin, the audience is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal until the end of the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffreys own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.

It debuted commercially in both countries on September 19, 1986, in 98 theatres across the United States. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $789,409. It eventually expanded to another fifteen theatres, and domestically grossed a total of $8,551,228.    It was also released internationally, in Australia, most of West Germany, China, Canada, Hong Kong, and Japan, followed by subsequent video releases.

===Critical reception===
Blue Velvet received critical acclaim in the United States upon its release and currently has a "certified fresh" score of 93% on Rotten tomatoes based on 59 reviews with an average rating of 8.7 out of 10. The critical consensus states "If audiences walk away from this subversive, surreal shocker not fully understanding the story, they might also walk away with a deeper perception of the potential of film storytelling."  The film also has a score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critics indicating "Generally favorable reviews." 

Paul Attanasio of   of the Los Angeles Times called the film "the most brilliantly disturbing film ever to have its roots in small-town American life." She called it "shocking, visionary, rapturously controlled."   

Looking back in his Guardian/Observer review, critic Philip French wrote, "The film is wearing well and has attained a classic status without becoming respectable or losing its sense of danger."  Peter Travers, film critic for Rolling Stone, named Blue Velvet the best film of the 1980s, and referred to the film as an "American masterpiece."  Film critic Gene Siskel included Blue Velvet on his list of the best films of 1986, at #5.

But Blue Velvet was not without its detractors. A general criticism from U.S. critics was the films often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence, which they claimed detracted from the films serious side.     One of the films detractors,   honoring David Lynchs birthday, Ebert later revealed though he views Lynch as a great director, his feelings remain unchanged about Blue Velvet.

Del Reys version, however, has her lip-synching "Blue Velvet" when a little person dressed as Frank Sinatra approaches and unplugs a hidden victrola, revealing Del Rey as a fraud.  When Lynch heard of the music video, he praised it, telling Artinfo: "Lana Del Rey, shes got some fantastic charisma and—this is a very interesting thing—its like shes born out of another time. Shes got something thats very appealing to people. And I didnt know she was influenced by me!"

"Now Its Dark", a song by American heavy metal band Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax on their 1988 album State of Euphoria, was directly inspired by the film, and specifically the character of Frank Booth.
